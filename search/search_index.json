You\u2019re about to begin learning how to use REV23 Desktop! Whether you\u2019re evaluating REV23 Desktop or have already made up your mind and signed up, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here with us. You\u2019re on the road to implementing a level of automation in your tattoo and/or body piercing business that you\u2019ve never dreamed was possible. Keep in mind that to accomplish this level of automation, setup is required and in some cases this can be time consuming to get right. Getting up and running with REV23 Desktop is not as effortless as installing software such as iTunes or Instagram. Figuring it out by just poking around isn\u2019t going to happen. Sure you could get close and find a flow that works for you, but you\u2019d miss a lot. Time and thought as well as dedication need to go into configuring the elements of REV23 Desktop in order to get the most out of it. You will not be sorry that you\u2019ve taken the time to configure the software and begin experiencing a truly automated shop! If you\u2019re unwilling to make this commitment then turn back now. I don\u2019t want you to be dissatisfied with your decision and would rather have you using another product than be unhappy with us. To be as successful as possible with REV23 Desktop, I recommend reading this user guide before you even install the software. Okay, stop laughing and/or groaning. Seriously, this is the best way to see what REV23 Desktop has to offer, and more importantly, it will get you to start thinking about how REV23 Desktop will fit in your business. This way, you have a general idea of how you will want to configure things to best suit your needs and have a good understanding of where you\u2019re going when you get into the software for the first time. Next, I recommend keeping an open mind about how you run your business as you go through this user guide. Professional tattooing in the United States dates back to 1846. As time has passed, business practices have evolved. For some of you, this may be your first time going from the traditional pen and paper bookkeeping to a software product like REV23 Desktop. Or perhaps you\u2019ve decided to switch to REV23 Desktop from another product that didn\u2019t quite suit your needs. In either case, REV23 Desktop has been designed for what we believe are the best practices in this industry, gathered from the collective knowledge of our many users and our own usage. This may not naturally fit into how you do things. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong. Maybe you\u2019re a trend setter. Perhaps what you\u2019re doing is genius. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d love to hear about it and see how we can support it. But perhaps you\u2019re using methods that have created complexities for you that are unnecessary. So, if you don\u2019t see how your process can fit in, think about that process, why it\u2019s necessary for you and see if the REV23 Desktop way makes a little more sense to implement. If you are stuck somewhere, send us an email at support@rev23.com and we\u2019ll be happy to help. Good luck and please let us know what you think. REV23 Desktop has evolved because of users like you.

Aftercare can be printed from a service, sale, or emailed automatically to the customer by the Virtual Receptionist after a service has been completed. It is recommended you familiarize yourself with the Templates topic before proceeding with this topic. Customizing Aftercare Forms Navigate to Configuration > Templates . Select a built-in aftercare form template provided by REV23. Click the Clone action to create your own copy. Click the Show Template Designer action. Make your desired changes in the Template Designer and save. Navigate to Configuration > Service Types . Double click a Service Type record that you wish to apply your new aftercare template to. Set the Aftercare Form property to your new template. Click the Save & Close action to save the Service Type. This service type will now use the selected template. Repeat steps 7-9 for each service type you wish to use this aftercare template. It\u2019s important to note that you do not need to create a separate aftercare form for each individual service type. Any property that exists on the service type, such as Healing Time, can be merged into the aftercare form template, so in most cases, you can reuse the same template across multiple service types such as all of your piercings. If you wish to create an empty template for your aftercare form rather than cloning an existing one, aftercare forms require a Template with the Data Type of Service . Emailing Aftercare Forms The Virtual Receptionist can email aftercare forms to your customers after a service is completed. An email will be sent to the customer containing a body, and a PDF attachment of the aftercare form. Navigate to Configuration > Virtual Receptionist . Ensure that the Email Aftercare Instructions workflow is active. This workflow will execute automatically for customers that have an email address for any service that has an End On time set and has ended within the last 24 hours. (Read: The service must have an end time set for this workflow to execute.) If you wish to disable this feature, simply deactivate the Email Aftercare Instructions workflow. Customize the Email Subject You can customize the subject of the email that is sent in Configuration > Custom Texts by modifying the custom text with key name WORKFLOW_AFTERCARE_EMAIL_SUBJECT . Customize the Email Body The body that is sent in the email is a template which you can customize. The template that is used for the email body can be changed in Configuration > Virtual Receptionist Options in the Email Aftercare Instructions Email Options tab. By default, this is the template with key name REV23_AFTERCARE_EMAIL_BODY , and is recommended you clone that template if you wish to change this text. The email body should not contain your aftercare instructions, but a more general email along the lines of \u201c Thank you for coming in to Gotham City Tattoo & Piercing, attached are the aftercare instructions for your new tattoo. \u201c Printing Aftercare Forms You can print an aftercare form from a Service by clicking the Print Aftercare action. Additionally, you can be prompted to print aftercare instructions after a sale containing one or more services has been fully paid. You can disable this prompt, or set it to always automatically print in Configuration: My Studio: Options: Service Options .

Set up Navigate to Security > Employees . Open the desired artist. Ensure they have an email address specified, preferably one they can check on their phone. Check the Use Cloud Calendar checkbox. Optionally, check the Customer contact information visible in Cloud Calendar checkbox if you would like a client\u2019s email address and phone number to be visible in the schedule. Click the Send Cloud Calendar Email button. An email will be sent to the artist containing a unique link resembling the below link, as well as instructions on how to setup their device. Sample Cloud Calendar Link: webcal://blob.mytattoostudio.com/calendars/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.ics iPhone & iPad Setup Tap each link in the received email and choose \u201cSubscribe\u201d when prompted. Depending on the email app used, if the link does not appear clickable, go to Settings, tap \u201cAccounts & Passwords\u201d, tap \u201cAdd Account\u201d, tap \u201cOther\u201d, tap \u201cAdd Subscribed Calendar\u201d. In the Server field, type or copy-and-paste the calendar link. iOS Auto Fetch By default, iOS will only sync the calendar manually. To automatically sync, go to Settings, tap \u201cPasswords & Accounts\u201d, tap \u201cFetch New Data\u201d, and select the desired interval under the \u201cFetch\u201d settings. Return to the previous screen and tap the Cloud Calendar in your account list. Ensure that its settings are set to Fetch. However, even with those settings, sometimes you\u2019ll find you just need to refresh the calendar manually. To do so, open the Calendar app, tap \u201cCalendars\u201d in the bottom middle of the screen, then pull down and release to refresh. This should force the calendar app to fetch a fresh version of your Cloud Calendar file. Android Setup From your PC, navigate to http://www.google.com/calendar, click the down-arrow next to \u201cOther Calendars\u201d, select \u201cAdd by URL\u201d from the menu. In the field provided, type or copy-and-paste the calendar link. Click the \u201cAdd calendar\u201d button. Your schedule will sync with your Google Account to your Android Phone. Android Behavior If you\u2019re using Google Calendar to sync your calendar to Android, you\u2019re really at the mercy of when and if these services decide to update your calendar. Google claims it may take up to 12 hours for changes to show up on Google Calendar. Unfortunately if using this platforms, all you can do is wait. See Other Apps below for alternate suggestions. Other Apps You may be able to find apps in your devices app store that support subscription based calendars that may give you more flexibility of synchronization. Of course these are to be downloaded and used at your own risk and are unsupported by REV23. Microsoft Windows: Outlook, included as a part of Microsoft Office, allows you to add internet calendars. Android: ICSDroid is a paid app, in no way affiliated with REV23, that helps eliminate the delay of Google Calendar updating your REV23 Cloud Calendar. This app allows you to sync an internet calendar directly to the device, and many REV23 users have reported success with it.

Consent Forms can be printed and signed, or signed electronically with the Signature Pad . It is recommended you familiarize yourself with the Templates topic before proceeding with this topic. Using the Signature Pad Using the Signature Pad you can capture signatures for your release forms and store them digitally. To initiate a client signature for a release form, click the Sign Consent Form action in a service. The signature pad cannot scroll text, so customers cannot read your entire release form on the pad. Users will generally have a laminated copy for their release form for customers to read and acknowledge. Customizing Consent Forms Navigate to Configuration > Templates . Select a built-in consent form template provided by REV23. Click the Clone action to create your own copy. Click the Show Template Designer action. Make your desired changes in the Template Designer and save. Navigate to Configuration > Service Types . Double click a Service Type record that you wish to apply your new aftercare template to. Set the Consent Form and/or the Guardian Consent Form property to your new template. Click the Save & Close action to save the Service Type. This service type will now use the selected template. Repeat steps 7-9 for each service type you wish to use this consent form template. It\u2019s important to note that you do not need to create a separate consent form for each individual service type. Any property that exists on the service type, such as Service Ty, can be merged into the aftercare form template, so in most cases, you can reuse the same template across multiple service types such as all of your piercings. If you wish to create an empty template for your consent form rather than cloning an existing one, consent forms require a Template with the Data Type of Service . If customizing the consent form template, ensure that you add the properties for the images of the signatures, otherwise they will not appear on the generated copy. - Service > Customer Signature Image - Service > Employee Signature Image - Service > Guardian Signature Image Auto Export After a release form is signed, it can optionally be automatically exported to a hard drive for extra protection. Ideally this hard drive should be an external hard drive. Another extra benefit of auto exporting is the ability to save to a cloud storage service such as OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive by setting your export path to a synced folder. You can configure auto export in Configuration: My Studio: Options: Signature Pad , and override the export path in Device Options . Guardian & Minor Consent Forms When a customer does not meet the Required Age property of the service\u2019s service type, REV23 Desktop will attempt to use the Guardian Consent Form configured for that service type. If a value is not set, you will not be able to proceed with the service. Printing Consent Forms You can print a consent form from a Service by clicking the Print Consent Form action. Emailing Consent Forms The Virtual Receptionist can email a copy of a signed consent form to your customers immediately after a they has been signed. An email will be sent to the customer containing a body, and a PDF attachment of the signed consent form. Navigate to Configuration > Virtual Receptionist . Ensure that the Email consent form workflow is active. This workflow will execute automatically for customers that have an email address. If you wish to disable this feature, simply deactivate the Email consent form workflow. Customize the Email Subject You can customize the subject of the email that is sent in Configuration > Custom Texts by modifying the custom text with key name WORKFLOW_CONSENT_FORM_CUSTOMER_COPY_EMAIL_SUBJECT . Customize the Email Body The body that is sent in the email is a template which you can customize. The template that is used for the email body can be changed in Configuration > Virtual Receptionist Options in the Consent Form Customer Copy Email Options tab. By default this is the template with key name REV23_CONSENTFORM_EMAIL_BODY , and is recommended you clone that template if you wish to change this text. The email body should not contain your consent form, but a more general email along the lines of \u201c Thank you for coming in to Gotham City Tattoo & Piercing, attached is your signed release form. \u201c Template Common Fields When modifying consent forms in the Template Designer , there are several fields that are useful to merge into your template from the Data Explorer.

While used the same, there are slight differences in how these different types behave and how they\u2019re created, but they both have the same goal, to reduce the balance of a sale. Each deposit/credit has a customer, as well as a starting balance. Credits A credit is money that exists on a customer account that can be used towards the purchase of a tattoo, piercing or retail item. They can be created manually in the Deposits & Credits list view, or more commonly issued as part of a refund as an in-store credit. Deposits Deposits behave similar to credits with one key difference, in order to be created, the customer must make a payment in exchange for the deposit. Deposits can be created manually in the Deposits & Credits list view if it is floating (it does not have an appointment associated with it), or more commonly created as part of creating an appointment. Reward Credits Reward credits are the same as credits with the exception that they are only created automatically by the Points system. Reward credits cannot be created manually. Deposit/Credit History Each deposit/credit has a list of history items (found in the History tab). Each history item has an adjustment amount which alters the Available Balance of the deposit/credit. For instance, If a deposit started at $200, a history item of Funds Removed with an adjustment amount of $50 , would reduce the Available Balance to $150. You can manually create history items to adjust the balance as needed, but more commonly they will be created in a few ways. Redeeming all or part of a deposit/credit on a sale. Forfeiting a deposit/credit. For example, when a customer doesn\u2019t show up for an appointment. Tipping an artist.

Deposit Agreement You can optionally require a customer to sign a deposit agreement, using the signature pad, when taking a deposit with the Sign Deposit Agreement action.

You can payout cash nightly, write checks weekly, payout individual services. Each method will be covered in its own topic. Service Payouts On occasion, you may find it necessary to selectively payout one (or a few) individual services or their tips. Perhaps the artist received a large tip today, or they need an advance to repair their car before their check that you\u2019re willing to help them out on by paying them out cash, or cutting them a check for what they\u2019ve earned. To accomplish this, open the detail view for the desired service and use the Payout Employee action. Check Payouts Cash Payouts Cash payouts in REV23 Desktop are an optional payout method for shops that like to payout cash nightly to their artists. The cash payout feature looks at several factors when determining what amount each artist can be paid in cash and there are some settings that you can use to customize it to your needs. Cash payouts are actually incredibly simple to do and a highlight feature of REV23 Desktop, so don\u2019t let the length of this topic fool you into thinking it\u2019s complicated. It is important that you understand how they\u2019re being calculated in the background so you can explain to your artists why they\u2019re receiving the amount of cash they\u2019re receiving. How cash payouts are calculated? Because REV23 Desktop uses some advanced formulas to calculate cash distribution, it may not always be obvious what it is doing. But you can trust that its behaving as designed. At a high level, we look at Services and Deposits (if you advance deposits to your artists) that were paid in cash each day. On the surface, and for the most basic scenarios, this works exactly as you\u2019d expect it to. A $200 tattoo at 50% commission, paid all in cash, the artist is eligible for $100 cash, their entire commission, or $50 cash, depending on your Default Cash Payout Mode setting in your studio\u2019s invoicing & payment options). However, take into account when a deposit is used to reduce the balance. That same $200 tattoo with a $125 deposit, with the remaining $75 paid in cash. In this case there isn\u2019t enough cash in the drawer to payout the full commission, so it will payout what it can. And imagine an even more complex scenario, in which a husband and wife are tattooed by separate artists, deposits are used, some aftercare is purchased, they put some on credit card, maybe some on a gift card, and pay with a little bit of cash. Who gets what part of the small amount of cash here? A real head scratcher, right? Not for REV23 Desktop. In short, Cash Payouts only look at the cash portion of the transaction. It then sets aside retail sales and tax, leaving behind only what should be split amongst services. It then determines the amount each artist is able to claim, using their percentage of the total invoice amount, and splits it proportionally, then rounds down to the nearest dollar so you\u2019re not attempting to split change, leaving their remaining commission for a check payout. As a result of this method, you\u2019ll often see some numbers that might not make sense at first glance. When you run into a question such as \u201cwhy am I paying out $22.00 in cash to Dave on a $500.00 tattoo when his commission is 60%?\u201d you can trust that it\u2019s simply because that\u2019s all the cash there was to hand out for that particular transaction. REV23 Desktop ensures that you aren\u2019t paying out more cash than is in the drawer. In your studio\u2019s Invoicing & Payment Options there is a \u201cDefault Cash Payout Mode\u201d setting which controls how cash is paid out. You can read more about it in the invoicing & payment options topic. Paybacks Paybacks are money that an employee owes back to the studio. These can happen for two reasons. First, deposit advances that were paid out will be paid back when the deposit is used so that the artist isn\u2019t paid twice for that deposit. Paybacks also occur if a return/refund has occurred and the commission that was paid out will be recollected. Payouts vs Payroll For a variety of reasons, we do not include, nor plan to include full payroll features in REV23 Desktop. We easily provide you with your artist\u2019s and employee\u2019s gross pay information based on their commissions on services, sales, deposits, etc\u2026 as well as hourly rate that you can pass over to an accounting software package or your accountant, but we do not calculate payroll taxes or print payroll checks. Here\u2019s the main reason: products like QuickBooks pretty much have this area covered and are trusted solutions. Breaking character of \u201canonymous user manual guy\u201d and speaking as the developer of REV23 Desktop, I wouldn\u2019t personally trust packages outside of true accounting packages like QuickBooks to deal with this. We\u2019re aware of the fact that some competitors offer these features, but our tax system (at least in the United States) is complex. Tax laws change, updates have to be made yearly, etc\u2026 this is a maintenance nightmare for us and not an area we\u2019re planning on exploring. On top of ever changing laws, you need a particular certification to be \u201caccounting software\u201d. This is not something we\u2019re interested in.

Usage A customer is issued points for each dollar they spend. Most commonly, for every dollar spent, they will earn one point, though you can override this per item or service type to issue a specific amount of points for these items. When enough points have been earned to redeem a credit, they will be cashed out and new reward credit will be added to the customer\u2019s profile to be used just like a normal deposit or credit. Set up Navigate to Configuration > My Studio . Click the Options tab. Click the Rewards tab. Check the Enable Points checkbox to turn on points. Set a Point Conversion Rate . This is the value of a single point in relation to one dollar. For example, 5% is equal to $0.05. Set the Auto Redeem Points Threshold . This is the dollar amount when a customer has earned enough points to be cashed in for a reward credit. For example, once the customer has enough points to issue $5.00 that\u2019s the point in which the points will cash out and convert to a credit.

Our studio is open 7 days a week, Sunday through Saturday. Each of the artists want weekends off. This is easily solvable with a rotating schedule. On week 1, Dave will have Saturday and Sunday off. Mike will have Monday and Tuesday off, and Casey will have Wednesday and Thursday off. On week 2, Dave will have Monday and Tuesday off, Mike will have Wednesday and Thursday off, and Casey will have Saturday and Sunday off. On week 3, Dave will have Wednesday and Thursday off, Mike will have Saturday and Sunday off, and Casey will have Monday and Tuesday off. We want everyone in on Friday because it\u2019s our busiest day. Every fourth week our schedule will start over again to week 1. To accomplish this scenario we will need three rotating schedules, each one assigned to one of the artists. Each schedule will have a start date one week apart from each other. We will also have three week definitions in each schedule. These week definitions will be identical in each schedule. The reason for this is in this scenario our schedule is exactly the same hours, we just want each of them to start on a different week creating the pattern we need. Set it up We will setup some rotating schedules to solve the \u201cI want weekends off!\u201d dilemma. Create a new Rotating Schedule and name it \u201cArtist Schedule 1\u201d. Set the rotation start date to any Sunday (past, present, future, it doesn\u2019t matter) where you want the first week to begin. We\u2019ll pick December 1st, 2013. Create a new Week Definition for the schedule in the nested list view. Set the week number to Week 1. Set the hours, in this case we\u2019ll set it to work every day except Saturday and Sunday. Create a new Week Definition for Week2, and set it to work every day except Monday and Tuesday. Create a new Week Definition for Week 3, and set it to work every day except Wednesday and Thursday. Clone the schedule In our example, we want each artist to use this same schedule, we just be offset by a single week. This is easy to accomplish. In the Rotation Schedule List View, Clone Artist Schedule 1. Change the name to \u201cArtist Schedule 2\u201d. 2. Set the rotation start date to be the Sunday after Artist Schedule 3. Save the new schedule. Now we have two versions of the same rotating schedule, but they both start one week apart from each other. We can now repeat those three steps for Artist Schedule 3 and we\u2019ll have three versions of the same schedule that we can assign to one artist each. Assign the schedule to a user Navigate to Security > Employees and open the detail view for the artist you\u2019d like to use Artist Schedule 1. Set their Rotating Schedule Group to Artist Schedule 1 and save their record. Repeat this for the artist that will use Artist Schedule 2 and Artist Schedule 3. Now, when you\u2019re scheduling appointments you\u2019ll always be able to easily tell if that is an artist\u2019s day off without guessing or trying to do head math. Conclusion This is one example of many useful scenarios for rotating schedules. You could have a single user that needs every other Monday off to deal with personal matters. One rotating schedule with two week definitions will do the trick. Additionally if you wanted to bring in a fourth artist to our scenario above but you only have three stations you could tighten the days, so one artist has Saturday and Sunday off and another has Sunday and Monday off, rather than Monday and Tuesday, etc\u2026 this would allow you to fit an extra artist in the schedule as a station would be empty every day of the week. Rotating schedules are very flexible and can allow you to create very complex or basic schedules.

Our studio is open 7 days a week, Sunday through Saturday. Each of the artists want weekends off. This is easily solvable with a rotating schedule. On week 1, Dave will have Saturday and Sunday off. Mike will have Monday and Tuesday off, and Casey will have Wednesday and Thursday off. On week 2, Dave will have Monday and Tuesday off, Mike will have Wednesday and Thursday off, and Casey will have Saturday and Sunday off. On week 3, Dave will have Wednesday and Thursday off, Mike will have Saturday and Sunday off, and Casey will have Monday and Tuesday off. We want everyone in on Friday because it\u2019s our busiest day. Every fourth week our schedule will start over again to week 1. To accomplish this scenario we will need three rotating schedules, each one assigned to one of the artists. Each schedule will have a start date one week apart from each other. We will also have three week definitions in each schedule. These week definitions will be identical in each schedule. The reason for this is in this scenario our schedule is exactly the same hours, we just want each of them to start on a different week creating the pattern we need.","title":"Rotating Schedules"},{"location":"concepts/rotating-schedules/#set-it-up","text":"We will setup some rotating schedules to solve the \u201cI want weekends off!\u201d dilemma.

To show the template designer for a template, highlight the desired template in the Template List View and click the Show Template Designer action. Fields When designing a template, you are creating a document that represents a single data object. For example, one service. Fields are special blocks that can be inserted into your template to act as placeholders for properties from that object. When you generate your template, fields will read data from that object and insert it into your template as text, an image, or even bar codes and check boxes. For example, when creating a consent form template for a service you would obviously want some key information that is populated when the consent form is generated such as the client\u2019s name, the date, etc\u2026 these can all be inserted as fields. Fields are accessed via the Data Explorer pane, which by default is located on the right of the document. Data Explorer The Data Explorer shows all available properties from the template\u2019s data type. At the root (top) of the data explorer you will see the object type assigned to the template. Underneath the root, you will see each of the properties of that object type. Some may expand with a [+] symbol next to each level. You can keep expanding each property until you reach the data you\u2019re looking for. For example, if the template has a data type of service, you will see the Service object at the top level. Underneath you will see properties such as Customer and Service Type which are separate objects of their own. Expanding the Customer property by clicking the [+] button will reveal the properties of a customer, such as their name, phone numbers, birthday, etc\u2026 Adding fields to a document To add a field from the Data Explorer to the document, either place their caret where you want to insert the data in the document, then double click the field, or click and drag the field from the data explorer to the document where you\u2019d like to place it. Field Properties Each field has its own set of options. The most important of these is the format string, meaning you can change how the field is displayed. For example, a date & time such as 10/30/2014 3:08 PM. Depending on how we want to layout our template, the time may not be relevant, leaving only 10/30/2014, or only the time might be relevant, leaving 3:08 PM. You may also want to format them with a long date, such as \u201cThursday, October 30, 2014\u201d. All of this is easily achievable. First, the field has to have already been added to the document. Next, click on the field (in document) to highlight it. You\u2019ll be taken to the Field ribbon page. On that page there is a Properties popup menu which allows you to configure the field. Click the ellipsis button [\u2026] on the Format String text box to invoke the format string editor. There, you can change the format to any standard type, or select a custom format. When you\u2019re done, click OK and the field will be formatted. See the Date/Time Format Codes topic for more information. Data Preview If data exists for the data type you\u2019re editing a template for, when a field is placed in the document, you\u2019ll see a random record\u2019s data as a preview. This assists in helping you layout your templates by showing real data. The space that <<Customer.Birthday>> takes up is much less than 10/31/1976 .

Open the user you wish to enable the time clock for. Check the Enable clock-in/clock-out editor. Optionally, fill in an hourly rate. Click the Save & Close action. When the time clock is enabled for a user, after they log on with their password they will be prompted if they would like to make an adjustment to their time card. This prompt will appear slightly different depending on their current status. Clocking-in If a user is clocked out, once they log on with their password they will be prompted to clock-in. This will put them on the clock and track their time until they clock-out. To clock in, the user can chose one of three options. Clock-in & log on: Creates a new time card entry with the current date & time and REV23 Desktop will continue to the Main Window. The user can use REV23 Desktop as usual. This option is only visible if the user has been assigned one or more Roles. Clock-in only: Creates a new time card entry with the current time, however REV23 Desktop will return to the log on screen. Log on only: Does not modify the time card and will show the main window. The user can use REV23 Desktop as usual. This option is only visible if the user has been assigned one or more Roles. Clocking-out If a user is clocked in, once they log on with their password they will be prompted to clock-out. This will end their current time entry and stop tracking their time. To clock out, the user can chose one of two options. Note: If the user is currently using REV23 Desktop they will need to log off, then log on again with their password in order to clock out. This is done so other users cannot clock-out a user and makes the process password protected. Clock-out: Modifies the user\u2019s current time card and sets the clock out time to the current date & time and REV23 Desktop will return to the log on screen.

Editing Time Clock Entries It\u2019s inevitable. From time to time your users will forget to clock in or out when they were supposed to. Here\u2019s how to fix this common scenario. Each time entry record consists of two values, the Clocked-in Date/Time and the Clocked-out Date/Time. Any entry without a clocked-out value is considered \u201con the clock\u201d. There can only be one \u201con the clock\u201d entry per user, meaning you cannot create a new time entry record if the user is on the clock, they must be clocked out first. User forgot to clock-in Go to the Time Clock List view, create a new Time Entry using the New action. Set the employee and the clocked-in date/time property to the necessary value. User clocked-in late Go to the Time Clock List View. Locate the record and modify the clocked-in date/time property to the necessary value.

Configure Email Settings The most common use of the Virtual Receptionist is sending emails and text messages.

For example, if you set Invoice Number Generation Mode to Date/Time, a property called \u201cInvoice Number Date Time Format\u201d will appear. But, what does this mean and what can you do with it? REV23 Desktop interprets this code and replaces it with the date time value to the specified format. For example, if the code is yyyyMMdd and the date to be formatted is March 14, 2013, REV23 Desktop will replace this value with 20130314. This works as follows: yyyy = The four digit year MM = The two digit month dd = The two digit date This is case sensitive, so you must be careful. For example, using mm rather than MM would be the date/time\u2019s minute value, rather than the month. You can use the table below to design your own date/time formats for use in REV23 Desktop.

They create an incentive for your artists to work all week long, bringing in as much revenue as they can, in order to increase their commission each week. They work like this: You create a Dynamic Commission, and add tiers to it. Each tier represents a commission percentage, and the dollar range required to achieve that commission. As an artist begins tattooing for the week, they start at their base commission. As the week progresses, the more tattoos they do, the higher the commission they can earn as they move through each tier. Once they enter a new tier, all of the week\u2019s previous tattoos will then adjust to reflect the new commission. Finally, at the beginning of the week, they restart back at zero and will start over again. Note: You can change the first day of the week that dynamic commissions use in your studio settings. After creating a dynamic commission you must set the Dynamic Commission property on each Service Type you wish the commission to apply to and additionally on each Employee you must set each of their Employee Service Types commission type to Dynamic. Properties Name: The name of the dynamic commission. The name is required and must be unique. Dynamic Commission Mode: The behavior to use when calculating a dynamic commission tier. Day : The target values must be accomplished in a single day. Services for that day will all adjust their commission to the appropriate tier. These totals will reset at the end of each working day. Week to Date : Target values must be accomplished in a single week. Services for that week will all adjust their commission to the appropriate tier. These totals will reset at the end of each week. Week Forward : Target values must be accomplished in a single week. Service commissions will only adjust to the new commission going forward for the week, rather than adjusting each previous service. These totals will reset at the end of each week. Tiers: The tiers nested list view is used to create or edit tiers within this Dynamic Commission. Dynamic Commission Tiers Commission Percentage: The commission percentage that will be earned for all services during the week once the artist enters this tier. Start Amount: The beginning amount of the range for this tier. When creating a new dynamic commission, you will always want a tier that starts at a zero amount. Each tier\u2019s start amount should be one cent (0.01) greater than the previous tier\u2019s end amount. The start amount is required to be greater than or equal to zero. End Amount: The high end of the range for this tier. The end amount is required to be greater than zero only when the And Up setting is unchecked. If the And Up property is checked, this value will be zero and disabled. And Up: If checked, this will act as the last tier in the dynamic commission. If they clear this value there is no higher commission that can be earned.

There are many options in the Location that control how you want REV23 Desktop to behave in your studio. REV23 Desktop supports business models that have multiple studios either in close proximity or across the country. If you have multiple studios you can chose to have them each have their own separate database, or share a single database. If shared, you will have some additional elements in the user interface to allow for location aware data. The Location Detail View (accessible for the studio you\u2019re currently logged into from the My Studio item in the Configuration navbar group) contains the basic information for your studio such as the name, phone number, address, etc\u2026 as well as a variety of options that control the behavior of REV23 Desktop. Main Name: The name of your studio. You can use the same name for multiple studios however you should use a name that is easy for you to identify each one. If you have two studios in the same city you probably already designate them with I, II, etc\u2026 so you should do that here as well for easy identification. The name is required. Owner Name: The first and last name of the owner(s) of the studio. Website: Your studio\u2019s web address. Email: Your studio\u2019s email address.

Open On Saturday/Saturday In/Saturday Out: Specifies if the studio is open on Saturday and if so the open and close times for that day. Use business hours when running reports: If checked, reports will use your actual business hours when filtering start and end dates. This is useful if you close after midnight and want those services to be counted for the previous calendar date. Running reports with this enabled will create a very strict time frame. For example, if you run a report for a Friday and you\u2019re open 12:00 PM to 10:00 PM, it will look for things that occurred between exactly those times. If something occurred at 10:02 PM, it will not show up on the report. Alternatively with this option turned off, reports run from 12:00 AM - 11:59 PM on the specified day. First Day Of Week: Specifies the first day of your studio\u2019s work week. This is used for various reporting, including dynamic commissions.

For example a 200.00 gift card with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Gift Card Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 gift card with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point.

Default Gift Card Point Application Type : The person who will earn points when a gift card is purchased or redeemed. This option can be overridden for each gift card sold. For example, if your default setting is to award the purchaser of the gift card points that is what will be used when you create a new gift card.

None : Neither party earns points when a gift card is purchased or redeemed. Purchaser : The customer who purchased the gift card will earn points at the time the gift card is purchased. Redeemer : The customer who received the gift card as a gift will earn points at the time they use the gift card.

For example, the barcode prefix of 1 will generate a barcode of 1000001 when an item is first created. You could use a string such as REV23 which would generate REV23000001. This should still be readable by the barcode scanner when printed, but it shouldn\u2019t be too long. Reuse barcodes from my other studios when available: If checked, and you have a connected studio license, when you add an inventory item to this studio that already exists in another it will use an existing Location Inventory Item barcode if available. Sales & Payments Options Sales Receipt: The report definition of the receipt you\u2019d like to print as a receipt for the customer.

Skip : You will not be prompted to print this document and it will not print automatically. If you\u2019d like to print it you will have to print it manually from the Application Button. This setting, as well as the \u2018Aftercare Printing Prompt\u2019 setting, located in Service Options, are somewhat dependent on each other. Regardless of the \u2018Skip\u2019 or \u2018Print\u2019 value here, if the Aftercare Printing Prompt is set to \u2018Prompt\u2019, you will still see the dialog asking if you would like to print, giving you the ability to optionally print the invoice receipt. In this scenario, if this setting is \u2018Print\u2019, the option to print the receipt will be checked by default, if it is set to \u2018Skip\u2019, the option to print the receipt will not be checked by default.

For example, a 200.00 invoice with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point for each service and sold item. Default Points Subtotal Multiplier: The multiplier to apply to the invoice subtotal when the Default Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Note: This property is only visible if the Default Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Default Points Custom: The static point value for each item and service on an invoice when the Default Card Points Type is set to Custom. Note: This property is only visible if the Default Points Type is set to Custom. Point Conversion Rate: The conversion rate of a single point to your local currency.

Referral Credit Options Referral Credit Mode: How you award referral credits to referring customers. None : Your studio does not offer referral credits. Per Customer : For each new customer that you create, the referring customer will receive the Referral Credit Amount after they\u2019re saved. Per Service : For each new service that you create, the referring customer will receive the Referral Credit Amount. This means that if Jack refers Sally, each time Sally has a service done, Jack will receive the Referral Credit Amount. Referral Credit Amount: The amount that will be created as a new credit for the referring customer for each new referral. Each time a referral happens a credit in this amount will be created for the referring customer. Service Options Enable Walk-in Queue: If checked, the Walk-in Queue feature will be available. If your studio is appointment only, or only do a couple walk-ins per day, you may not need this feature.

This behavior can be overridden on each service if necessary, this provides the default value. Don\u2019t adjust payouts : The commission/draw for both the studio and the employee are not adjusted when a discount is applied. You will pay out based on the full amount. Reduce both payouts based on subtotal : The commission/draw for both the studio and employee will calculate on the new subtotal, but their percentages will remain the same. Location absorbs discount amount in payout : The location\u2019s draw will be reduced to absorb the discount. The employee will retain their full commission amount.

Automatically set the service end time when it is added to an invoice: If checked, the service end time (the date & time the service was finished) will be set when the service is added to an invoice. If you take payment after a service has been completed it makes sense to use this option since many features rely on a service end time being set. Aftercare Printing Prompt: The behavior that will be used when REV23 Desktop would prompt you to print aftercare forms for all the services on an invoice. Prompt : You will be prompted to print the document when it is ready. You can then decide for each case whether or not to print the document or skip it. Print : The document will automatically be sent to the default printer for this document type when it is ready. Skip : You will not be prompted to print this document and it will not print automatically. If you\u2019d like to print it you will have to print it manually from the Application Button.

Regardless of the \u2018Skip\u2019 or \u2018Print\u2019 value here, if the Customer Invoice Receipt Printing Prompt is set to \u2018Prompt\u2019, you will still see the dialog asking if you would like to print, giving you the ability to optionally print the aftercare form. In this scenario, if this setting is \u2018Print\u2019, the option to print the aftercare will be checked by default, if it is set to \u2018Skip\u2019, the option to print the aftercare will not be checked by default.

This path should not be located on your system drive (i.e. C:) instead it should be on a separate internal hard drive or an external hard drive. If your system drive was to crash you would lose access to your auto exported release forms, which defeats the purpose of this feature. Alternately, you could point this to a cloud storage folder such as OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive. Create a subfolder containing the service type: If checked, the auto exported release forms will be placed in a folder that contains the service type\u2019s name in the path. For example, if your Auto Export Path is D:\\ConsentForms, they will be placed in subfolders such as D:\\ConsentForms\\Tattoo Create a subfolder containing the service date: If checked, the auto exported release forms will be placed in a folder that contains the service\u2019s date in the path.

You have three tattoo stations in your studio but want to hire a fourth artist. These problems and many more are easily solvable with rotating schedules. How do they work? On the surface rotating schedules may seem complicated, but they\u2019re actually quite simple. You create a rotating schedule, set a start date, which is any Sunday where the first week of the schedule will land, then define each week\u2019s schedule (1-4) and then assign the schedule to a user in their profile.

Imagine the following scenarios: You have multiple artists that all want weekends off. You have an artist that has an appointment every other Wednesday and isn\u2019t in the studio. You have three tattoo stations in your studio but want to hire a fourth artist. These problems and many more are easily solvable with rotating schedules. How do they work? On the surface rotating schedules may seem complicated, but they\u2019re actually quite simple. You create a rotating schedule, set a start date, which is any Sunday where the first week of the schedule will land, then define each week\u2019s schedule (1-4) and then assign the schedule to a user in their profile. Once assigned, the user\u2019s working hours on the scheduler will change week to week, allowing you to book your appointments for them easily and effectively without wondering \u201cis this their day off?\u201d","title":"Rotating Schedules"},{"location":"configuration/rotating-schedules/#rotating-schedule-properties","text":"Name: The name of the Rotating Schedule.

You can provide multiple tiers where you can create a structure of discounts based on their quantity, such as two piercings = 10% off, three piercings = 15% off, four to five piercings 20% off, six or more piercings 25% off.

This is how REV23 knows who is able to do what, and what their commission should be for each. For example, how an artist gets paid for a tattoo vs. how they get paid for different piercings. See Employee Service Types for more information. Service Type Properties Name: The name of the Service Type. The name is required and must be unique. Family: The body modification family of this service type. - Tattoo - Piercing - Other - Permanent makeup Category: The category of the service type. The category is required. Department: The department of the service type. Healing Time: The typical healing time for this service type. The healing time appears on the default aftercare forms, so while not required, it\u2019s a good idea to fill this out. Useful to fill out for adding to aftercare forms . Downsize/Change Out Time: The typical amount of time before the piercing should be downsized. Useful to fill out for adding to aftercare forms . Required Age: The minimum age the customer needs to be to provide their consent for this service type. Consent Form: The consent form template to be used for this service type. Guardian Consent Form: The consent form template to be used for this service when the customer is younger than the required age. If no guardian consent form is specified, it is assumed you are not allowed to perform that service type on minors and REV23 Desktop will prevent you from proceeding with the service. Aftercare Form: The aftercare form template to be used for this service type. Require Placement Area: If checked, you will be required to manually fill in the placement area on the service before you can save the record. This is recommended if your consent form requires the placement area to be provided. Require Amount: If checked, you will be required to have specified an amount for a service before you can save the record. Default Pricing Type: The default pricing type controls how this service type is priced. Custom : The price is determined per service. This is the best option for tattoo service types because the amount is variable. Fixed - Location : The amount is a fixed shop amount, provided in the Amount property. This option is best if you charge a standard amount for each service of this type and is unaffected by who is performing it. Fixed - Employee : The amount is predetermined by the Amount property in the Employee Service Type record. This option is best if you have levels of piercers that charge a different amount for the same type of piercing. Duration : The amount is calculated based on the Employee\u2019s hourly rate and the Total Hours that are manually entered in the service. Time (Start/End) : The amount is calculated based on the Employee\u2019s hourly rate and the start and end time of the service.

Override Points: If checked, you can specify a different point structure than provided in your studio\u2019s default points. This is useful if you want to structure service points separately from retail points, or want to run limited promotions. For example, you may have a weekend where all ear piercings earn double points. You could then override points on your service types for lobe, tragus, helix, etc\u2026, then remove the override after the promotion has ended. Points Type: The method for calculating points. None : No points are awarded to a customer. Subtotal : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal. For example, a 200.00 invoice will earn 200.00 points.

We fully support multiple studios in a number of ways, allowing you to decide what\u2019s best for you. You will need to make a decision about how you want to use REV23 Desktop with your multiple studios, either isolated or connected. We can provide guidelines, but ultimately the decision is yours to make. What is an Isolated Studio? An isolated studio is a REV23 Desktop server setup at each physical location. You may have only one studio (in which case you don\u2019t really need to read any further in this topic), or you may have eight of them, but when isolated, no studio has any knowledge of the other. They are completely separate. Each studio has its own database, SQL Server, REV23 Desktop Control Panel, and Services. Even though isolated, REV23 Desktop can optionally be configured to allow you to connect to multiple databases. In this scenario you will be prompted for which database to connect to before seeing the log on screen. You will then see the normal logon screen for that studio. This feature is optional. For example, the studios themselves would never have to be prompted for the connection they would just default to their own database, and this prompt would likely be exclusive to the owner\u2019s PC. With multiple isolated studios, you can have REV23 Desktop prompt you for which database you\u2019d like to connect to. In this scenario, both studios in California and New York are isolated and you can choose which one you\u2019d like to connect to before you see the log on screen. What is a Connected Studio? Connected studios are when a REV23 Desktop server is setup at one studio, and your other studios connect to it with Add-on PCs via Remote Connections. The big benefits to connected studios is the ability to share customers, employees, vendors, inventory items, templates, notes etc\u2026 as well as optionally making deposits and gift cards redeemable at any of your businesses. Even when connected, you can treat the studios as isolated if you\u2019d prefer, meaning you don\u2019t have to mingle things, but the options are there for you should you chose to do so. There are some possible negative side effects when using connected studios, however. Because the database is physically in a different location, the connected studios that exist outside of the walls of the database are often a bit slower to perform tasks. There is a lot of data going back and forth, so the internet has to be fast and it has to be stable. When connected, there is only one database serving all locations from one physical location, one REV23 Desktop Control Panel and the Virtual Receptionist, Integration Service and Backup Service all handle each studio. In this scenario, two studios are connected. When working with connected studios you will choose the location in the same database you want to log on to on the log on screen. Deciding between Isolated or Connected studios Now, you have to decide how you want to setup each one. Once you chose a path it\u2019s not particularly easy to shift should you decide to change it later. Use these guidelines to help you determine what might be a better fit for you. These are only guidelines, you\u2019re free to choose whichever implementation you\u2019d like. Connected Studios Are your studios geographically close together where a customer may go to one or the other? Do you have artists that travel between your studios? Would you like to check inventory at another one of your studios without calling them? Do all studios have high speed internet that is reliable and always on? If some of all of these are true, Connected Studios might be for you. Isolated Studios Are your studios geographically far apart? Would it be unlikely that an artist would travel between your studios? Is your internet at one or more studios slow or unreliable? Are your studios completely separate businesses? Are you the managing owner of one studio, while a partner mostly owns another studio? If some or all of these are true, Isolated Studios are probably the way to go. Mix and Match You may have studios that meet a little bit of each criteria. For example, you might have a few studio\u2019s geographically close where the artists do travel between them, and then have one on the other side of the country. Consider that you could use connected studios on one set, then isolate the others.

When you want to do reporting on how much aftercare vs body jewelry you\u2019ve sold, its much easier to visualize by department than drilling down category by category.","title":"Inventory Departments"},{"location":"inventory/inventory-departments/#properties","text":"Name: The name of the inventory department.

The REV23 Desktop Inventory system is unmatched by competitors for how specific it is to our industry. Along with real time inventory tracking, automated bulk discounts and more, REV23 Desktop includes powerful options to associate items to specific service types, allowing full control on how to automate inventory when dealing with particular procedures. For example, discounting a piece of jewelry because it was done with a particular piercing type, including free aftercare that is automatically added (and discounted) on the sale during particular service types, or even reducing your disposables (gloves, needles, tubes, etc\u2026), after completing a service. Properties Name: The name of the inventory item. The name is required, and should be descriptive as this will be the main identifier of the item in REV23 Desktop and printed on sale receipts. Category: The inventory category of this item. The category is required. Categories are used mostly for organization of your items for quick access. Department: The inventory department of this item. The department is optional but recommended. Departments are useful for reporting at a high level (i.e. how much aftercare have you sold, regardless of brand or type). Inventory Item Type: The particular type of item (if applicable). - General: A general use item that is not specific to tattooing or piercing such as gloves or a t-shirt. - Tattoo: An item specific for tattooing. - Piercing: An item specific for piercing which will have more properties in the Piercing Item Specifications property. Jewelry Details: Additional properties used to describe a jewelry item. To access them, click the ellipses button on the editor (\u2026) to show the jewelry detail view. This property is only visible when the inventory item type is set to Piercing. If you leave the inventory item name blank, after setting the jewelry item specifications a name will be automatically generated for you. It will also look at other properties such as material to generate this name, so fill out all details in the Inventory Item detail view first, then move onto this view to generate a standardized name. This is particularly useful for jewelry. Quantity Per Unit: The usable or sellable quantity in this item. If you buy this as a single item, the quantity per unit is one (1). If however, you purchase this in a case of twenty four (24), the usable quantity will be twenty four (24). Likewise a single box of gloves would likely have a quantity per unit of one hundred (100). This is an important factor in determining cost per unit pricing, as well as reordering. For example, if its a case, when you receive two cases, it will at 48 to your quantity on hand. So this is an important value not to get wrong, so think about how you use and sell the item before setting this value. Color: The primary color of this inventory item.

Points Type: The method for calculating points. None : No points are awarded to a customer. Subtotal : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal. For example, a 200.00 invoice will earn 200.00 points. Subtotal Multiple : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal then multiplied by the Points Subtotal Multiple property. For example a subtotal of 200.00 on an invoice with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 service with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point. Points Subtotal Multiplier: The multiplier to apply to the invoice subtotal when the Default Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Note: This property is only visible if the Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Points Custom: The static point value for each item and service on an invoice when the Default Card Points Type is set to Custom. Note: This property is only visible if the Points Type is set to Custom. Ordering Quantity Per Unit: The inventory item\u2019s quantity per unit property, re-displayed here for reference. This value cannot be modified. Reorder Point: The value at which when the on hand count is less than or equal to this value, you would like to reorder more. Reorder Units: How many units you generally reorder. Quantity In Order: This calculated value displays what will go back into your inventory with the specified reorder units. It is calculated as Quantity Per Unit * Reorder Units as a visual reference for you to see if your quantity per unit, as well as reorder units values are correctly configured. On Hand: How many of this item you currently have in inventory. Units On Order: How many units of this item you currently have on order. Use Automatic Ordering: If checked, when the on hand value is less than or equal to the reorder point, the Units On Order will automatically update itself to be the Reorder Units value. REV23 Desktop assumes you\u2019ll have ordered the item, and will add it to your items to be received. Use Reorder Notification: If checked, a task will be created for anyone in the built-in Inventory Manager role when the on hand value is less than or equal to the reorder point to notify them they should reorder more. Service Types: A list of service type inventory items linked to this item. History: A list of history for this item\u2019s on hand value. Here you can see when and why the on hand value changed, whether it was sold, a manual change, etc\u2026 Do you need to put all of this stuff in? Nope. It\u2019s totally up to you. We realize this is a whole lot of information, but we offer it for those studios who want very in-depth reporting of their inventory. This level of inventory customization allows you to questions such as \u201cdoes anodized jewelry sell better than non anodized?\u201d So it all depends on what you as a shop owner are interested in.

But one thing has always bothered at her\u2026 just who was Batman? With her new business, she\u2019s got an idea that she thinks will allow her to discover his secret identity. By tattooing and piercing the citizens of Gotham, she will be able to look for any distinctive scars or other clues that would show signs that the client is possibly the mysterious Batman. In the meantime though, she wants to put out some killer artwork and have some fun. Harley has enlisted her friends to help out at the shop. She has hired Pam Isley, also known as Poison Ivy, who happens to be a gifted tattoo artist (mostly floral designs); and Selina Kyle, also known as Catwoman, as a body piercer, and manager of the shop. Each will be paid 50% commission on their services. As the manager, Selina will also receive hourly pay of $10.00/hour.

REV23 guidance is to not use the Administrator account unless you\u2019re making configuration changes or need to correct data. Using an account with the least amount of permissions possible to get the job done is always the best policy. In addition to hiring Selina as a piercer, Harley has also made her the shop manager. Navigate to Security > Employees . Double click the user. Click the Add Roles action. Select the Manager role and click OK . You do not need to add a manager or owner to every role available. The Manager role is a special role which contains all permissions and in fact, having other roles in addition to the Manager role can result in degraded permissions. Check the Enable clock-in/clock-out checkbox. Set the Hourly Rate to $10.00 . Check the Require a password change on next log on checkbox. This user\u2019s password is currently empty.

Consent and Aftercare forms, as well as other various bits of text, such as the text message and email appointment reminders, exist as Templates, which we will edit using the Template Designer . You must be logged in as the Administrator user or a user having the Manager role assigned to proceed with this topic. Open the Template Designer Navigate to Configuration > Templates to open the Template List View. Select the Consent Form for Tattoo (REV23) , and click the Clone action. This will open the Template Detail View for our newly created copy. Cloning an object creates a copy. In the case of templates, any template that is built into REV23 Desktop is overwritten each time a new update is installed. By creating a copy, we ensure that our changes are not overwritten. Provide a new Name to make this easily recognizable as your copy. Click the Show Template Designer action on the ribbon to open the Template Designer. The Template designer is a full word processor that allows you to format your templates however you\u2019d like, as well as insert fields that are populated from the database. The Template Designer itself is a complex topic, so here we will only cover the basics and make a couple of changes. Looking at the Template Designer, we can see some data already exists from a service we created earlier. These are only previews of the Service records we created earlier and will not be saved when you save the template. It will randomly show you a record so that you can see what the template looks like with actual data. This is useful so you can see what longer names or larger IDs do to the formatting of the template and make sure to adjust for them. Don\u2019t worry, this data is not saved to the template and is only there for preview purposes. Even though we are modifying the Tattoo Consent Form you may see a piercing service. That\u2019s ok. You can change the record you\u2019re looking at by using the Mail Merge tab on the ribbon and changing the Current Record editor to scroll through up to 50 records. We see a couple of changes we\u2019d like to make. First, we can get more text on the form by changing the margins. Click the Page Layout tab. Click the Margins button and select Narrow as the margin choice. Now we\u2019d like to update the consent form to use the Mobile Phone Number . Erase the entire line that says Home Phone: <<Customer.HomePhoneNumber>> and replace with Mobile Phone: and leave the cursor blinking in that spot. On the right hand side of the Template Designer is the Data Explorer . This allows us to insert a field which will read data from the database. In this case, a release form is based on the Service data type, so we can access all properties of a Service here. Scroll to the top of the data explorer window. Notice the arrows next to some Properties (those that contain other properties.) For example, Customer is a property of Service , and Mobile Phone Number is a property of Customer . So, we\u2019ll need to expand the Customer property to see what we have access to. Locate the Mobile Phone Number property nested inside the Customer Property ( Service > Customer > Mobile Phone Number ). Double click it to add it to the spot where the cursor is currently blinking. You can also click and drag it to the spot you\u2019d like. We\u2019re now properly displaying the mobile phone number. If the current record does not have a value for that property you will see the place holder value. Our template looks pretty good, and we can come back to it later at any time to add additional details or formatting. But now, we need to tell REV23 Desktop to use this template instead of the default. Save the Template using the Save action in the top left corner of the Template Designer to close it. Click the Save & Close action in the Template Detail View. Set the service type consent form Now we need to instruct REV23 Desktop to use our custom release form instead of the default one. Navigate to Configuration > Service Types Locate the Tattoo service type in the Service Type List View and double click it to open the Service Type Detail View. This detail view should look familiar as we saw it earlier when we were setting service prices. Change the Consent Form property to the new template we just created. Click the Save & Close action to close the Service Type Detail View. That\u2019s it! We\u2019ve now created a new template for our Tattoo Consent Form and have told REV23 Desktop to use it for tattoos instead of the default. Repeat this process for any additional service types that will use this same template. Harley will also modify the piercing consent forms using these same steps, as well as the Aftercare Forms, where you will use th Guardian Consent Form and Aftercare Form properties of the Service Type. Templates are versatile and easily reused. For example, you don\u2019t need a different template for each piercing type. Using the values from each service type, you\u2019re able to insert fields for the name, healing time, etc.. so don\u2019t create more templates than you really need.

Consent and Aftercare forms, as well as other various bits of text, such as the text message and email appointment reminders, exist as Templates, which we will edit using the Template Designer . You must be logged in as the Administrator user or a user having the Manager role assigned to proceed with this topic.","title":"Quick Start: Modify consent form"},{"location":"quick-start/modify-consent-form/#open-the-template-designer","text":"Navigate to Configuration > Templates to open the Template List View. Select the Consent Form for Tattoo (REV23) , and click the Clone action. This will open the Template Detail View for our newly created copy. Cloning an object creates a copy. In the case of templates, any template that is built into REV23 Desktop is overwritten each time a new update is installed. By creating a copy, we ensure that our changes are not overwritten. Provide a new Name to make this easily recognizable as your copy. Click the Show Template Designer action on the ribbon to open the Template Designer. The Template designer is a full word processor that allows you to format your templates however you\u2019d like, as well as insert fields that are populated from the database. The Template Designer itself is a complex topic, so here we will only cover the basics and make a couple of changes. Looking at the Template Designer, we can see some data already exists from a service we created earlier. These are only previews of the Service records we created earlier and will not be saved when you save the template. It will randomly show you a record so that you can see what the template looks like with actual data. This is useful so you can see what longer names or larger IDs do to the formatting of the template and make sure to adjust for them. Don\u2019t worry, this data is not saved to the template and is only there for preview purposes. Even though we are modifying the Tattoo Consent Form you may see a piercing service. That\u2019s ok. You can change the record you\u2019re looking at by using the Mail Merge tab on the ribbon and changing the Current Record editor to scroll through up to 50 records. We see a couple of changes we\u2019d like to make. First, we can get more text on the form by changing the margins. Click the Page Layout tab. Click the Margins button and select Narrow as the margin choice. Now we\u2019d like to update the consent form to use the Mobile Phone Number . Erase the entire line that says Home Phone: <<Customer.HomePhoneNumber>> and replace with Mobile Phone: and leave the cursor blinking in that spot. On the right hand side of the Template Designer is the Data Explorer . This allows us to insert a field which will read data from the database. In this case, a release form is based on the Service data type, so we can access all properties of a Service here. Scroll to the top of the data explorer window. Notice the arrows next to some Properties (those that contain other properties.) For example, Customer is a property of Service , and Mobile Phone Number is a property of Customer . So, we\u2019ll need to expand the Customer property to see what we have access to. Locate the Mobile Phone Number property nested inside the Customer Property ( Service > Customer > Mobile Phone Number ). Double click it to add it to the spot where the cursor is currently blinking. You can also click and drag it to the spot you\u2019d like. We\u2019re now properly displaying the mobile phone number. If the current record does not have a value for that property you will see the place holder value. Our template looks pretty good, and we can come back to it later at any time to add additional details or formatting. But now, we need to tell REV23 Desktop to use this template instead of the default. Save the Template using the Save action in the top left corner of the Template Designer to close it. Click the Save & Close action in the Template Detail View.","title":"Open the Template Designer"},{"location":"quick-start/modify-consent-form/#set-the-service-type-consent-form","text":"Now we need to instruct REV23 Desktop to use our custom release form instead of the default one.

Click the Save & Close action to close the Service Type Detail View. That\u2019s it! We\u2019ve now created a new template for our Tattoo Consent Form and have told REV23 Desktop to use it for tattoos instead of the default. Repeat this process for any additional service types that will use this same template. Harley will also modify the piercing consent forms using these same steps, as well as the Aftercare Forms, where you will use th Guardian Consent Form and Aftercare Form properties of the Service Type. Templates are versatile and easily reused. For example, you don\u2019t need a different template for each piercing type. Using the values from each service type, you\u2019re able to insert fields for the name, healing time, etc.. so don\u2019t create more templates than you really need.

Select the appointment from the Agenda and click the Start Service action. This will create a new service based on the details of the appointment and open the Service Detail View. Now, we\u2019re in a service like we were when we created that walk-in service . The only difference here is that by using the Start Service action, the service knows it created from an appointment (so we can later track walk-in services vs scheduled appointments), and some of the info has been filled out for us already\u2013 but not everything. Because he was just jogging by when he decided to make an appointment, he didn\u2019t have his ID for us to scan at the time. We\u2019re also missing some important information such as his address. Click the Open Related Record action in the Customer editor. This will open the Customer Detail View for that customer. Pro-tip: The Open Related Record action is extremely useful. Learning to incorporate it into your flow will make you much more efficient. Now that we have his ID, we can click the Scan/Swipe ID action in the Customer Detail View on the ribbon to easily and instantly populate the information we didn\u2019t get earlier, such as his address and ID number. Now, the next time the client is here, swiping his ID will recall this customer record and we avoid a duplicate record. We can make any other necessary additions, then click the Save & Close action to return to the Service Detail View. At this point, this is just as simple as the service we did earlier! Back in the Service Detail View, we still have some additional things we need to set up. Add the following properties: Service Type: Tattoo Placement Area: Back Design Description: USMC w/ GCPD Badge Amount: $500 By default, the Tattoo service type is set to a Custom pricing type. With this pricing type, we\u2019re able to just type that amount in, unlike the walk-in service we did earlier, where the price was automatically set when we selected the service type. The Signature Pad was delivered this morning and Selina\u2019s plugged it in. Click the Sign Consent Form action. The customer will be prompted to join the mailing list (optional) as well as review the Service Agreement (not the actual consent form since the signature pad cannot scroll text), then provide their signature. When the customer signs the consent form, the signed copy will be generated as a PDF and stored digitally in the database. Let\u2019s inspect it. Click the Attachments tab. Highlight the consent form and click the Open action. The Consent Form will open in your default PDF application. Inspect it to ensure it looks good and his signature appears. You can see that it is now using the Consent Form template we customized yesterday. There are a few more changes we could make to get this to print all on a single page, for example, utilizing tables to place the ID and the signature side by side, or changing the font size. While you don\u2019t need to inspect the release form each time, it\u2019s a good idea to check it out every once in a while, especially if you have recently made changes to your release form. Click the Save & Close action to save this service. Notice the Appointment has disappeared from the Agenda and is now in the Services list in the Today Dashboard . Pam will be tattooing the Commissioner for a few hours, so we\u2019ll check back in when she\u2019s done and ready to take payment and apply his deposit.","title":"Quick Start: Start a scheduled service"},{"location":"quick-start/start-a-walk-in-service/","text":"Quick Start: Start a walk-in service The appointment we scheduled isn\u2019t until tomorrow.

Click the Service Types tab to show Pam\u2019s Service Types that we configured in the Adding a service provider topic. Double click the Tattoo service type to open the Employee Service Type Detail View. Change the Commission Type editor to Dynamic, and set the Dynamic Commission editor that appears to our newly created Dynamic Commission. Save & Close this detail view, as well as the Employee Detail View. Hint: If all users that perform this service type will use the same dynamic commission, you can instead set the Dynamic Commission property on the Service Type record in Configuration -> Service Types. By setting it on the employee level, as we\u2019ve done here, we would be able to create different dynamic commissions based on abilities and experience. For example, some studios may have a Class A, Class B, and Class C commission structure, where the demands of Class C are much harder to meet than the Class A tiers. However, in either scenario, you still must change the Dynamic Commission Type for each employee as we\u2019ve done in this step. We\u2019re done! What you\u2019ll notice now is, when you create a new tattoo service for Pam, her Commission Type will be Percent, however, her commission percentage will be set to 0%. Once the service is saved, REV23 Desktop will look at her other services that participate in this same sliding scale commission for that week and adjust the commission amount appropriately. At the beginning of the next week, her totals will reset to $0.00 and she will again be at a 50% commission. Upon creating this Dynamic Commission, it will not immediately update past services for the current week, because at the time those services were created, they did not participate in this dynamic commission. It is advised you wait to enable dynamic commissions until the start of a new week before any services have been performed. As a work around, you could open each Service Detail View for the current week that you wish to update, and change either the service type or employee editors to a different value, then change them back to. Performing this step causes the service to update its commission values to the current configuration for that service type and employee.","title":"Incentivize artists"},{"location":"quick-start-2/incentivize-artists/#quick-start-vol-2-incentivize-artists","text":"Pam has been turning down a lot of tattoo work since the shop opened. The citizens of Gotham City don\u2019t seem to share her same affection of floral tattoos, despite how much she tries to convince them otherwise. Harley thinks creating a dynamic commission (also known as a sliding scale commission), which will increase her commission the more she tattoos, may create the incentive Pam needs to stop turning away tattoos that aren\u2019t flower and plant themed. We previously set Pam to have 50% commission on tattoos she performs when we added her as a service provider. We will modify her commission settings to use our new dynamic commission. Using this new commission type, her commission will adjust each week based on her revenue. Her new pay structure will be as follows: 50% for $0 - $1,999 55% for $2,000 - $2,499 60% for $2,500 or more. You will need to be logged on as the Administrator or a Manager to proceed with this topic. Note: Dynamic Commissions use the First Day Of Week setting in Studio Options. This setting determines the date when a new week begins and the hashed total of services resets.","title":"Quick Start Vol 2: Incentivize artists"},{"location":"quick-start-2/incentivize-artists/#set-it-up","text":"Navigate to Configuration -> Dynamic Commissions and click the New action to create a new Dynamic Commission Detail View.

Harley wants to reward her loyal customers by enabling Reward Points. Rewards work like this: For each purchase a customer is awarded a certain number of points, generally based on the subtotal of a purchase. For example, $100.00 = 100 points, though you can customize this. After a customer has earned enough points they will be redeemed for a credit that can be used just like a Deposit/Credit . Configuration is simple once you figure out these things. A: How much will the redeemed credit be worth? B: How much does the client need to spend to earn that credit? REV23 requires the conversion rate of a point to an actual dollar. Which is A divided by B , multipled by 100 . (A / B) * 100 In the case of Gotham City Tattoo, Harley will reward a customer with $5.00 for every $100.00 they spend. So, five (dollars) divided by one-hundred (dollars) $5.00 / $100.00 = 0.05 Take the result or 0.05 and multiply by 100. 0.05 * 100 = 5.00% So 5% is our conversion rate which we will need to configure REV23 Desktop.

Properties Service Type: The service type you\u2019re creating or modifying for this employee. License Number: The employee\u2019s issued license number to perform this service type. License Expiration Date: The expiration date of this employee\u2019s license. When specified, you will be warned when creating a service of this type once the expiration is sixty (60) days away from the current date, then, every ten (10) days afterwords until there is only ten (10) days remaining, at which point you will be warned every day. Amount: The fixed amount to charge for this service when being performed by this artist. This value is only used if the Service Type\u2019s Pricing Source is set to \u2018Fixed - Employee\u2019. This is useful if you have levels of piercers that charge a different amount for the same type of piercing (i.e. master piercer, apprentice, etc\u2026). Area Rate: For tattoos, the rate to charge per square inch, foot, etc\u2026 (whichever measurement unit you\u2019ve decided on). This value is only used when the service\u2019s pricing source is set to \u2018Area\u2019. Hourly Rate: For tattoos, the rate to charge per hour. This is calculated by the service\u2019s start and end time. Hourly Rate Minimum: When using an hourly rate, the minimum amount to charge in the event the rate with the service\u2019s total time is less than the artist\u2019s minimum. Rounding Direction: When the commission is calculated using an hourly rate and the start and end time of the service, you can round the time up or down to the nearest quarter, half or full hour. None : The total hours will not be rounded, it will be an exact value of time. Up : The total hours will be rounded up to the nearest interval, specified below. Down : The total hours will be rounded down to the nearest interval, specified below. Rounding Interval: When the rounding direction is set to a value of Up or Down, you need to specify the interval in which the time will round to. Quarter : Round to the nearest 15 minute interval. Half : Round to the nearest 30 minute interval. Full : Round to the nearest 60 minute interval. Taking a service end time of 4:05 PM / 16:05, the following scenarios will show you how REV23 Desktop will round the time. Combination Result Up/Quarter 4:15 PM / 16:15 Down/Quarter 4:00 PM / 16:00 Up/Half 4:30 PM / 16:30 Down/Half 4:00 PM / 16:00 Up/Full 5:00 PM / 17:00 Down/Full 4:00 PM / 16:00 Note: This property is only visible when Rounding Direction is set to Up or Down. Commission Type: The portion of the commission the employee will take when this service is performed in the Employee Payout. Think hard about how your commissions work before choosing this value, as you will configure the artist/piercer commission on their Employee Service Type record, so you\u2019ll obviously want everything to match up in the end. For example, setting this value to a percentage of 60%, then having your studio configured at 50% would equal 110%, which obviously wouldn\u2019t work, but REV23 Desktop will not stop you in this scenario. None : No Employee Payout will be calculated. Any remainder left over after the studio\u2019s commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Fixed : The Employee Payout will be a fixed amount, provided in the Commission Amount property. This option is less common. Any remainder left over after the studio\u2019s draw has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Percent : The Employee Payout will be a percentage of the service amount, provided in the Commission Percentage property. Any remainder left over after the studio\u2019s draw has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. This is the most common commission type, as it easily allows you to specify the artist/piercer\u2019s commission percentage. Remainder : The Employee Payout will be whatever amount is remaining after the studio\u2019s draw has been calculated. Dynamic : The Employee Payout will be dynamically adjusted using the dynamic commission set on this User Service Type. Commission Percentage: The percentage of the employee payout. This property is only visible if the Commission Type is set to Percent. Commission Amount: The amount of the employee payout. This property is only visible if the Commission Type is set to Fixed.

This value is only used when the service\u2019s pricing source is set to \u2018Area\u2019. Hourly Rate: For tattoos, the rate to charge per hour. This is calculated by the service\u2019s start and end time. Hourly Rate Minimum: When using an hourly rate, the minimum amount to charge in the event the rate with the service\u2019s total time is less than the artist\u2019s minimum. Rounding Direction: When the commission is calculated using an hourly rate and the start and end time of the service, you can round the time up or down to the nearest quarter, half or full hour. None : The total hours will not be rounded, it will be an exact value of time. Up : The total hours will be rounded up to the nearest interval, specified below. Down : The total hours will be rounded down to the nearest interval, specified below. Rounding Interval: When the rounding direction is set to a value of Up or Down, you need to specify the interval in which the time will round to. Quarter : Round to the nearest 15 minute interval. Half : Round to the nearest 30 minute interval. Full : Round to the nearest 60 minute interval. Taking a service end time of 4:05 PM / 16:05, the following scenarios will show you how REV23 Desktop will round the time. Combination Result Up/Quarter 4:15 PM / 16:15 Down/Quarter 4:00 PM / 16:00 Up/Half 4:30 PM / 16:30 Down/Half 4:00 PM / 16:00 Up/Full 5:00 PM / 17:00 Down/Full 4:00 PM / 16:00 Note: This property is only visible when Rounding Direction is set to Up or Down. Commission Type: The portion of the commission the employee will take when this service is performed in the Employee Payout. Think hard about how your commissions work before choosing this value, as you will configure the artist/piercer commission on their Employee Service Type record, so you\u2019ll obviously want everything to match up in the end. For example, setting this value to a percentage of 60%, then having your studio configured at 50% would equal 110%, which obviously wouldn\u2019t work, but REV23 Desktop will not stop you in this scenario. None : No Employee Payout will be calculated. Any remainder left over after the studio\u2019s commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Fixed : The Employee Payout will be a fixed amount, provided in the Commission Amount property. This option is less common. Any remainder left over after the studio\u2019s draw has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Percent : The Employee Payout will be a percentage of the service amount, provided in the Commission Percentage property. Any remainder left over after the studio\u2019s draw has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. This is the most common commission type, as it easily allows you to specify the artist/piercer\u2019s commission percentage. Remainder : The Employee Payout will be whatever amount is remaining after the studio\u2019s draw has been calculated. Dynamic : The Employee Payout will be dynamically adjusted using the dynamic commission set on this User Service Type. Commission Percentage: The percentage of the employee payout. This property is only visible if the Commission Type is set to Percent. Commission Amount: The amount of the employee payout. This property is only visible if the Commission Type is set to Fixed. Dynamic Commission: The dynamic commission to use. This property is only visible if the Commission Type is set to Dynamic.","title":"Properties"},{"location":"reference/user-service-types/#connected-studio-behavior","text":"Location Employee Service Types: A list showing the specific service types options for this service type in all of your connected studios.

An employee must be assigned one or more roles in order to log on to REV23 Desktop. Each role contains settings such as the ability to print and export, as well as a list of type permissions (appointments, services, customers all being different types). Along with each type you\u2019re able to specify what users in that role are able to do: Read (see data), Write (save data), Create (create new records), Delete (delete records) and/or Navigate (visible in the navbar). Roles also evaluate permissions from the bottom up, meaning the lowest level permission always wins. As an example, you assign a user to the manager role, then assign them to a lower role such as cashier, some things may be disallowed. For this reason, if you want to assign a user to the manager role that should be the only role they\u2019re assigned to. Several roles for the most common scenarios are built-in and should mostly suit your needs. If you need to modify roles at any time you should not modify the built-in roles as they are overwritten with each REV23 Desktop update and your changes would be lost. Instead you can either clone an existing role to make minor tweaks, or create a new role entirely, which will remain untouched during system updates. Roles can get quite complex, and this topic will only cover the very basics. If you\u2019re interested in modifying roles you should first contact REV23 Support, to explain what you would like to do so we can assist you. The roles that are built-in are required by the system and cannot be deleted or renamed. Role Additives Some roles are known as Additive roles. These can be distinguished by the plus symbol (+) in front of their name. For example, the + Discounts, and + Payouts roles. Additive roles are not full roles themselves, and only add functionality to existing roles. For example, be default, only the Manager role can add discounts to services and retail items. By adding the + Discounts role to a user in the cashier role, that user will now be able to discount services and items. A warning about creating custom roles There are some drawbacks to creating/cloning your own roles. If a type permission does not exist in a role, it will deny access completely. So, take the built-in Inventory Manager role for example. It contains all of the types used for inventory configuration and management. Lets say you like the Inventory Manager as it is, but want to make one minor change\u2026 you want to prevent those users from deleting inventory items. You could clone the role, remove the delete permission from the Inventory Item type and then assign the new role to your users and everything will work great. However, if in a new version of REV23 Desktop we introduce a new inventory configuration object, our built-in Inventory Manager role would include that new type, but your cloned version would not. Because of this you would not immediately see the new object type (or perhaps not even know that it exists at all), until you manually add the type to your custom role. For this reason we recommend sticking to the default roles or creating additive roles. If you have suggestions on how we can improve the default roles, please let us know. Connected Studio Behavior Roles are global and do not differ between your connected studios. However, users can exist in different roles in each of your studios. So you could have a piercer that travels between two of your studios in the service provider role, but also exist in the manager role in their primary studio.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"security-concepts/roles/#roles","text":"Roles are sets of individual permissions that control what your users are able to see and do in REV23 Desktop.

Solution 1 The most common cause of this problem is that the user is not properly configured to receive a commission for the missing service type(s). Services where the commission would be zero do not appear on payout reports. As the Administrator user, open the Service Detail View of the Service that is missing, and inspect the payout information. Is there a commission set? If not, this user does not have a properly configured Employee Service Type record for the selected service type. Note that after you modify the commission for that Employee Service Type, it does not retroactively apply to existing services. If you wish to include the missing services after correcting the user\u2019s commission, you can return to each service individually for that user and either modify the Employee or Service Type property, then revert it back to the correct value. This will refresh the configuration for that service, including payout data. Solution 2 If you\u2019ve verified that the user is being paid a commission on that service but it\u2019s still not showing up on payout reports, it is likely being filtered by the Use Business Hours for Reporting option in Locations and My Studio.

Some are used for navigation and others are object specific. If an action appears dimmed then that action is disabled for the selected object(s). Records Creation Clone: In some views, a Clone action will appear. Think of the clone action like a copy & paste with with objects. Creating a clone will take the selected object\u2019s values and create a new object with those existing values in place. This is particularly useful for inventory items where you want to create a variant of a single item. Edit Delete: The Delete action will delete either the currently selected row(s) in a list view, or the current object in a detail view. You can find the Delete action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the Edit group. Deleting some objects, such as an Invoice, will present a different user interface than the standard prompt. When an object is deleted, in most cases it technically stays in the database but is invisible to the user interface. This way you do not lose record of those objects if they were set as a property on another object. Use caution when deleting objects. While they technically remain in the database, once deleted they cannot be recovered by either yourself or Support. View Refresh: The Refresh action will refresh the data in the list view or a single object in a detail view. You can find the Refresh action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the View group. When you refresh in a list view the list will be refresh from the database. For example, if you have add-on PCs connecting to the REV23 Desktop database and one PC has the Customer List View opened and on another PC a new customer is added, you can execute the Refresh action on the first PC and that customer will now appear in the Customer List View. When you refresh in a detail view that single object will have the data that is in the database loaded. For example, if you have multiple PCs connecting to the REV23 Desktop database and one PC makes a change to a customer you also have opened, you can execute the Refresh action on the first PC and that customer\u2019s new data will be loaded, however, changes you have made will be discarded. If you have add-on PCs you don\u2019t always need to refresh manually. Switching between list views is enough to refresh the data. Only when that view is already opened and you want to load new data do you need to manually execute the Refresh action. Similarly when you open a detail view it will read the new data from the database. Only when that detail view is already opened do you need to manually refresh. Reset View Settings: The Reset View Settings action will reset any view customizations for the currently logged in user, such as column sorting, visibility, detail view editors, etc\u2026 back to defaults. This only applies to the current view. Show Change History: The Show Change History action will show the selected object\u2019s audit trail, or change history. The change history is a useful tool to show what changes have been made to an object such as the date/time it was created, modified, what the previous value was, what the new value was set to, as well as who made the change. This creates accountability in your shop by your users. You can find the Show Change History action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the View group. Open Related Record Open Related Record: The Open Related Record action is a big time saver though some of its options and benefits may not be immediately obvious. It allows you to click on a property in the view you are currently in and open the record that is currently selected. You can find the Open Related Record action on the Home tab of the ribbon in the Open Related Record group. Imagine this, you\u2019ve started a new Service and selected a customer. The customer is clearly not a minor but the service is requiring a guardian is present. The problem is that the customer\u2019s birthday has either been entered incorrectly or not entered at all in their customer profile. You can highlight the Customer property in the Service record and then click the Open Related Record button. This will open that customer\u2019s profile where you can correct their birthday and save and close that record. Now, the service is no longer requesting a guardian and you can proceed. Open Related Record is only available on properties that are a link to another object in the database known as reference objects. You can find out more about these objects in Lookup List Views. Workflow Show Virtual Receptionist History: When the Virtual Receptionist begins a workflow on an object it stores a history of what happened in the database. This history can be accessed with the Show Virtual Receptionist Instances action. You can find the Show Virtual Receptionist History action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the Workflow group of any list view or detail view. This is useful if you are alerted by a customer that they did not receive their text message or email appointment reminder. You can find their appointment, execute this action and see if that workflow ran or not and if so if it Completed, meaning they should have received it, or Aborted, meaning there was a problem when that workflow was run. Records Navigation Previous Record/Next Record: The Previous Record/Next Record actions allow you to navigate between objects in the database. In a detail view this is useful when trying to find or inspect certain data. You can open the detail view for the first object, then use the Next Record action to load the next object into the database into your currently loaded detail view.

Think of the clone action like a copy & paste with with objects. Creating a clone will take the selected object\u2019s values and create a new object with those existing values in place. This is particularly useful for inventory items where you want to create a variant of a single item.","title":"Records Creation"},{"location":"ui/common-actions/#edit","text":"Delete: The Delete action will delete either the currently selected row(s) in a list view, or the current object in a detail view. You can find the Delete action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the Edit group. Deleting some objects, such as an Invoice, will present a different user interface than the standard prompt. When an object is deleted, in most cases it technically stays in the database but is invisible to the user interface. This way you do not lose record of those objects if they were set as a property on another object. Use caution when deleting objects. While they technically remain in the database, once deleted they cannot be recovered by either yourself or Support.","title":"Edit"},{"location":"ui/common-actions/#view","text":"Refresh: The Refresh action will refresh the data in the list view or a single object in a detail view. You can find the Refresh action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the View group. When you refresh in a list view the list will be refresh from the database. For example, if you have add-on PCs connecting to the REV23 Desktop database and one PC has the Customer List View opened and on another PC a new customer is added, you can execute the Refresh action on the first PC and that customer will now appear in the Customer List View. When you refresh in a detail view that single object will have the data that is in the database loaded. For example, if you have multiple PCs connecting to the REV23 Desktop database and one PC makes a change to a customer you also have opened, you can execute the Refresh action on the first PC and that customer\u2019s new data will be loaded, however, changes you have made will be discarded. If you have add-on PCs you don\u2019t always need to refresh manually. Switching between list views is enough to refresh the data. Only when that view is already opened and you want to load new data do you need to manually execute the Refresh action. Similarly when you open a detail view it will read the new data from the database. Only when that detail view is already opened do you need to manually refresh. Reset View Settings: The Reset View Settings action will reset any view customizations for the currently logged in user, such as column sorting, visibility, detail view editors, etc\u2026 back to defaults. This only applies to the current view. Show Change History: The Show Change History action will show the selected object\u2019s audit trail, or change history. The change history is a useful tool to show what changes have been made to an object such as the date/time it was created, modified, what the previous value was, what the new value was set to, as well as who made the change. This creates accountability in your shop by your users. You can find the Show Change History action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the View group.","title":"View"},{"location":"ui/common-actions/#open-related-record","text":"Open Related Record: The Open Related Record action is a big time saver though some of its options and benefits may not be immediately obvious.

The customer is clearly not a minor but the service is requiring a guardian is present. The problem is that the customer\u2019s birthday has either been entered incorrectly or not entered at all in their customer profile. You can highlight the Customer property in the Service record and then click the Open Related Record button. This will open that customer\u2019s profile where you can correct their birthday and save and close that record. Now, the service is no longer requesting a guardian and you can proceed.

The Ribbon is the replacement for the standard toolbar many Windows users have been used to for decades. It is the modern way to help you find, understand, and use commands efficiently and directly with a minimum number of clicks, with less need to resort to trial-and-error, and without having to refer to Help. The Ribbon was first introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 and continues to be used and evolved in many Microsoft products. The Ribbon appears on top of the Main Window and in most Detail Views. By default it appears expanded at its full size, however it can be minimized to save room on your screen. It consists of tabs and actions (or buttons) that are grouped into sections, and the File menu on the far left. There are some actions on the ribbon that are consistent throughout REV23 Desktop. However, there are some that appear only in lists views, some that appear only in detail views and some that are specific to certain data types. The Ribbon in a generic List View. Notice the List View specific action \u2018New\u2019. Also in this example notice the different elements. The Home tab is selected showing us it\u2019s actions. Also notice how the actions are contained in groups. For example, the \u2018New\u2019 button appears in the \u2018Records Creation\u2019 group. The Ribbon in a generic Detail View. Notice the Detail View specific actions \u2018Save\u2019 and \u2018Save and Close\u2019 that appear in the \u2018Save\u2019 group. Minimizing the Ribbon If you\u2019d like to collapse the ribbon to save room on your screen you can double click on one of the ribbon tabs and the ribbon will minimize (only the application button and tabs will be visible). To access the actions in the ribbon when it is minimized, single click a tab and the ribbon will drop down allowing you temporary access to the full ribbon. After you execute an action the ribbon will minimize itself again. To expand the ribbon, just double click the tab again. There is also an arrow on the far right that allows you to collapse and expand the ribbon. The ribbon in its minimized state. Notice the arrow on the right hand side that allows you to minimize and expand the ribbon as desired. Collapsed Groups In some situations when there are more items to display on the ribbon than it can fit on your screen, groups will collapse. These groups are recognizable by an arrow pointing down. In order to access that groups items you need to click the group and a popup window will appear allowing you access to those items. Notice in this example the Workflow, Full Text Search groups are collapsed, while the View group\u2019s icon sizes have been reduced. Here, the Full Text Search group was clicked, allowing access to the search box. The File Menu The File Menu button shows File Menu. Here you can print and export as well as access some other useful features that are view specific. The File Menu always appears in the top left corner of REV23 Desktop. The file menu button. Depending on your selected skin the button may appear different. The application button\u2019s standard menu. Quick Access Toolbar Also part of the ribbon is the Quick Access Toolbar, which as you might guess allows you quick access to your favorite actions. By default, it appears in the top left hand corner of the ribbon. However it\u2019s position can be moved to below the ribbon if desired by clicking the \u2018Customize Quick Access Toolbar\u2019 button which appears on the right hand side of the list. The Quick Access Toolbar shows the Refresh, Previous Record, Next Record, Log Off and Touch Mode actions by default. The Quick Access Toolbar displayed below the Ribbon. Any action can be added to the Quick Access Toolbar by right clicking it and select the \u2018Add to Quick Access Toolbar\u2019 item. Alternatively you can remove items from the quick access toolbar by right clicking the action and selecting the \u2018Remove from Quick Access Toolbar\u2019 item.

It is the modern way to help you find, understand, and use commands efficiently and directly with a minimum number of clicks, with less need to resort to trial-and-error, and without having to refer to Help. The Ribbon was first introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 and continues to be used and evolved in many Microsoft products. The Ribbon appears on top of the Main Window and in most Detail Views. By default it appears expanded at its full size, however it can be minimized to save room on your screen. It consists of tabs and actions (or buttons) that are grouped into sections, and the File menu on the far left. There are some actions on the ribbon that are consistent throughout REV23 Desktop. However, there are some that appear only in lists views, some that appear only in detail views and some that are specific to certain data types. The Ribbon in a generic List View. Notice the List View specific action \u2018New\u2019. Also in this example notice the different elements. The Home tab is selected showing us it\u2019s actions. Also notice how the actions are contained in groups. For example, the \u2018New\u2019 button appears in the \u2018Records Creation\u2019 group. The Ribbon in a generic Detail View. Notice the Detail View specific actions \u2018Save\u2019 and \u2018Save and Close\u2019 that appear in the \u2018Save\u2019 group.","title":"What is the Ribbon?"},{"location":"ui/ribbon/#minimizing-the-ribbon","text":"If you\u2019d like to collapse the ribbon to save room on your screen you can double click on one of the ribbon tabs and the ribbon will minimize (only the application button and tabs will be visible).

The following topics will explain what those elements are, the terminology that will be used in this user guide, how to use those elements as well as how to customize their appearance. Due to the constant evolution of REV23 Desktop, screenshots in this user guide may not appear exactly as you see them on your screen. Features are regularly added and changed which occasionally modifies the user interface before we\u2019ve had a chance to update the user guide. In this brief topic, we will talk about the terminology we use to refer to different areas of the user interface. Understanding this terminology will be valuable as you go through these docs. UI Short hand for user interface. Main Window The primary UI of REV23 Desktop. This window is where you will switch between area\u2019s of the software, generally to different list views. Navigation Bar Appearing only in the main window, the navigation bar provides access to grouped items that you will use to navigate around the software. Ribbon The ribbon is the tabbed toolbar on top of most windows, including the main window and most detail views. This provides access to various actions. Action A clickable control that performs some action, generally having the appearance of a button that is located on the ribbon and sometimes in detail views. Because they\u2019re not always a button, but sometimes a selector or other control, they\u2019re called actions, however we may refer to them occasionally as buttons if it makes more sense in the context. List View A list view is a collection of data, presented in a list format in a powerful grid. For example, a list of your customers. Column A column vertical (up & down) data in a list view. For example, the First Name property in the Customer list view. Row A row is horizontal (left & right) data in a list view. For example, one single and specific customer in the Customer list view. Detail View A detail view is a separate window from the main window which presents the data of a single object. For example, double clicking a row in the Customer list view will open that customer\u2019s detail view. This is where you will edit that record\u2019s data such as entering a first and last name. Property A property of the object in a detail view. For example, the First Name of a customer. Editor An editor is a control which allows you to edit a property of an object. For example a text editor will allow you to type text such as a customer\u2019s first and last name, while a date editor will present a calendar for you to pick a date for a birthday. Nested List View A nested list view is a list view that appears inside of a detail view to represent a collection of objects related to the detail view. For example, a list of services a customer has received at your studio. Nested list views have their own toolbars with specific actions such as deleting an object from that list. Lookup List View A lookup list view is a small list view that appears as a result of clicking some editors. They are used for selecting other objects in your database to link to the record. For example, when selecting a customer for a service, when clicking the \u201cCustomer\u201d editor, you will be shown a small version of the Customer list view to select the customer who will be receiving the service.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"ui/terminology/#ui-terminology","text":"There are several important elements that make up the REV23 Desktop user interface, which will sometimes be referred to as the UI.
