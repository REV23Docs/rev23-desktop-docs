# My Studio

Your tattoo and/or body piercing studio in REV23 Desktop is referred to as a Location. There are many options in the Location that control how you want REV23 Desktop to behave in your studio.

REV23 Desktop supports business models that have multiple studios either in close proximity or across the country. If you have multiple studios you can chose to have them each have their own separate database, or share a single database. If shared, you will have some additional elements in the user interface to allow for location aware data.

The Location Detail View (accessible for the studio you're currently logged into from the My Studio item in the Configuration navbar group) contains the basic information for your studio such as the name, phone number, address, etc... as well as a variety of options that control the behavior of REV23 Desktop.


## Main

**Name:** The name of your studio. You can use the same name for multiple studios however you should use a name that is easy for you to identify each one.

> Running reports with this enabled will create a very strict time frame. For example, if you run a report for a Friday and you're open 12:00 PM to 10:00 PM, it will look for things that occurred between exactly those times.

**First Day Of Week:** Specifies the first day of your studio's work week. This is used for various reporting, including dynamic commissions.

## Inventory Options

**Default Sales Tax:** The default sales tax to use when creating new sellable location inventory items.

**Barcode Prefix:** If defined, the automatically generated barcode for  inventory items will start with this text. It can be used to easily identify a barcode as being from a particular studio if you have multiple studios.

This property can be a number, or even a short bit of text. For example, the barcode prefix of 1 will generate a barcode of 1000001 when an item is first created.  You could use a string such as REV23 which would generate REV23000001. This should still be readable by the barcode scanner when printed, but it shouldn't be too long.

**Reuse barcodes from my other studios when available:** If checked, and you have a connected studio license, when you add an inventory item to this studio that already exists in another it will use an existing Location Inventory Item barcode if available.

## Sales & Payments Options

Regardless of the 'Skip' or 'Print' value here, if the Aftercare Printing Prompt is set to 'Prompt', you will still see the dialog asking if you would like to print, giving you the ability to optionally print the invoice receipt. In this scenario, if this setting is 'Print', the option to print the receipt will be checked by default, if it is set to 'Skip', the option to print the receipt will not be checked by default.

### Payouts

**Default Cash Payout Mode:** The default behavior for how to distribute cash during Cash Payouts.

**Default Service Discount Payout Adjustment:** The default behavior for how to adjust commissions when discounting a service. This behavior can be overridden on each service if necessary, this provides the default value.

+ *Don't adjust payouts*: The commission/draw for both the studio and the employee are not adjusted when a discount is applied. You will pay out based on the full amount.

> This setting as well as the 'Sale Receipt Printing Prompt' setting, located in Invoicing & Payment Options, are somewhat dependent on each other.

**Auto Export Path:** The drive and folder that your consent forms are exported to.

> This path should not be located on your system drive (i.e. C:\) instead it should be on a separate internal hard drive or an external hard drive. If your system drive was to crash you would lose access to your auto exported release forms, which defeats the purpose of this feature. Alternately, you could point this to a cloud storage folder such as OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive.

**Create a subfolder containing the service type:** If checked, the auto exported release forms will be placed in a folder that contains the service type's name in the path.

For example, if your Auto Export Path is D:\ConsentForms, they will be placed in subfolders such as D:\ConsentForms\Tattoo
