# Magstripe Swipe Card Reader

## Device Driver

No device driver is necessary for the Magstripe Swipe Card Reader for use in REV23 Desktop.

## Changing reading modes

In order to work properly with REV23 Desktop, the Magstripe Swipe Card Reader must be using Keyboard Emulation, not HID  (Human Interface Device). Most magstripe swipe card readers shipped by REV23 are already configured for Keyboard Emulation, but every once in a while, we will ship one pre-configured for HID based on our stock status.

You can test if your magstripe swipe card reader is using Keyboard Emulation mode by opening Notepad (notepad.exe) and swiping a card. Does text 'type' into the window? If not, the device may be in HID mode. Luckily, this is easily fixed using one of the method below.

Follow the directions carefully.
